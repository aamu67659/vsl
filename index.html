<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Oluwaseun Moses. I am 35 years old, born and raised in Nigeria, and currently living in Canada with my two wonderful children. My journey has been shaped by a deep appreciation for family, culture, and growth, and I’m proud of the life I’ve built across two continents.

Growing up in Nigeria, I was surrounded by a strong sense of community, tradition, and resilience. Those early years played a key role in forming the person I am today—someone who values hard work, integrity, and perseverance. Life in Nigeria taught me to appreciate both challenges and opportunities, and those lessons have carried me through every stage of my journey.

After spending my formative years in Nigeria, I made the life-changing decision to move to Canada. Like many immigrants, the move wasn’t easy, but it was driven by my desire to provide a better future for myself and, most importantly, for my children. Canada has offered me the opportunity to grow in new ways, both personally and professionally. It’s a country full of diversity, inclusion, and possibilities, and I’m grateful to be part of it.

As a father of two, my children are my greatest motivation. Everything I do is with their well-being and future in mind. They inspire me daily to be a better person and to lead by example. I take pride in being a present and supportive parent, guiding them with the values I grew up with—kindness, responsibility, and faith.

In addition to family life, I am passionate about continuous learning and self-improvement. Whether it’s through formal education, personal reading, or everyday experiences, I believe in always striving to become better. I’m interested in making a positive impact, whether in my community, workplace, or within my own family.

Looking ahead, I hope to continue growing—both as a person and as a father. I aim to create a legacy that my children will be proud of, and to serve as a role model not only for them but for others around me. My story is still unfolding, and I look forward to embracing every new chapter with purpose and gratitude.</p>
